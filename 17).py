# 17) What are negative indexes and why are they used?
#
# In Python, negative indexing is a feature that allows you to access elements in a sequence
# (such as lists, strings, or tuples) from the end rather than the beginning.

# - Negative indexes make it easy to access elements from the end of a sequence without needing
# to know its length. This can be especially useful when you want to retrieve elements relative
# to the end of the sequence.
#
# -Using negative indexes can make code more readable and intuitive in cases where
# you('re interested in the end portion of a sequence. For instance, seq[-1] clearly indicates the last element,'
# ' whereas seq[len(seq) - 1] is less straightforward.)

# -Negative indexing is a powerful and convenient feature in Python that enhances flexibility
# and readability when working with sequences. It simplifies accessing elements from the end of a sequence
# and can make certain operations more intuitive.
